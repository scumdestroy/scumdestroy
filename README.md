### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Offsec Cybermage casting technoincendiary incantations across the internet so you can reassemble the pieces into something more impressive.  

I wrote a book on recon for pentesters, bug bounty hunters and OSINT lifers recently - "Enumerating Esoteric Attack Surfaces" is the most comprehensive and esoteric tome on performing uncomfortably pervasive data sweeps against your target.  The hidden attack surfaces will go from subterranean whispers of ghosts to radioactive bioluminescent glowies after you read this book.
